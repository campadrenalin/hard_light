# HARD LIGHT

> "I don't care if they kill everyone in this room. In this building. With me in it. I don't give a fuck. What I care about is what happens when - not if - they get _out_ of here. Nothing known to man can do anything except slow them down. I honestly think if they see the light of day they're gonna eat the fucking sun, because it got in the way. And I like the sun, so I'm gonna buy all the time my life will trade for. You wanna run? Go. See how far you get."
